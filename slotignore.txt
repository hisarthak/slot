# slotignore file
 This file is used to specify files and folders that should be ignored by the repository.
 Each line in this file represents a file or directory that will be excluded from tracking.

- To ignore a specific file or folder, simply write its name or path.
  For example:
  .env                # Ignores the .env file
  node_modules        # Ignores the node_modules folder
  package-lock.json   # Ignores the package-lock.json file
  .git                # Ignores the .git folder
    
- Use relative paths from the root of the repository.
- Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored (for comments).

Note: Ensure that no additional spaces or characters are present when specifying paths.  

# Below are some default ignored files and folders. You may choose to modify these based on your repository's needs.
